# Revision for Coding Interviews

This is a collection of implementation of the data structures and algorithms covered in Chap 3 through Chap 5 of **The Algorithm Design Manual** by Skiena. In Node.js 6.x, since that is my strongest language.

# Install

Clone and `npm install`. The packages are really there for the `eslint` to work correctly.

# TODOs

* Move test cases out in to the test folder, and make everything pretty :sparkles:
* Create a branch with all the implementation blank so I could start from scratch again.
